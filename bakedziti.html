    <h2>discription</h2>
    <p>Baked Ziti is the ultimate comfort food—warm, cheesy, and packed with flavor. It’s made with tube-shaped pasta (ziti), which holds onto rich meat sauce and creamy cheese in every bite. Unlike lasagna, there's no need to layer carefully—just toss, bake, and enjoy. The combination of tender pasta, savory meat, tangy tomato sauce, and gooey melted mozzarella makes it a guaranteed family favorite. It’s perfect for busy weeknights, potlucks, or make-ahead meals, as it reheats beautifully and tastes even better the next day.</p>
