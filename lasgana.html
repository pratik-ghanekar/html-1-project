      <h2>discription</h2>
      <p>This classic lasagna is a hearty, comforting Italian dish made with layers of tender pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella.The meat sauce typically features ground beef or a mix of beef and pork, slow-cooked with garlic, onions, tomatoes, and Italian herbs. Between each layer of sauce and pasta, generous amounts of cheese add creaminess and depth of flavor. Baked until bubbly and golden on top, this dish is perfect for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prepping. Serve it with a side of garlic bread or a fresh green salad for a complete, satisfying meal.</p>
